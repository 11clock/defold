Releasing the Game (bundle)
===========================

This guide explains how to release the game on supported platforms.

Introduction and platform similarities
--------------------------------------

All settings for your application are specified in the game.project file located in the project root directory. The following properties are common for all platforms:

* *project*
** _title_ - the title of the application. The title is used for the package directory and game title
** _version_ - the version of the application in major/minor format, e.g. 1.0. The version is used on platforms where applicable, e.g. CFBundleShortVersionString on Mac OSX.


Mac OSX
-------

On Mac OSX an application icon must be specified with the _osx.app_icon_ property. The application icon is of type http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format[Apple Icon Image format] and
contains multiple resolutions of the image. The icon can be created using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Developer_Tools#Icon_Composer[Icon Composer] or
with the tool http://iconverticons.com[iConvert].
Bundle your application using the menu option *Project > Bundle OSX Application...*

Specify an output directory where the application bundle should be created. Signing Mac OSX applications is currently not possible using the editor. It's however
possible to sign the bundle manually. See the following guide http://successfulsoftware.net/2012/08/30/how-to-sign-your-mac-os-x-app-for-gatekeeper[How to sign your Mac OS X App for Gatekeeper].

NOTE: It's possible to bundle and release Mac OSX applications on both Windows and Linux.

Windows
-------

On Windows an application icon must be specified with the _windows.app_icon_ property. The application icon is of type http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)[ICO] and
contains multiple resolutions of the image. The required resolution are: 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 in 32-bit format.
The icon can be created using the tool http://iconverticons.com[iConvert].
Bundle your application using the menu option *Project > Bundle Windows Application...*

Specify an output directory where the application files should be created.

NOTE: It's possible to bundle and release Windows applications on both Mac OS X and Linux.
