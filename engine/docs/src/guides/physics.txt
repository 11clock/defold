Collision Objects & Shapes
--------------------------

A _collision object_ is a component which extends a game object with physical behaviour.
Examples are colliding with other game objects (with collision objects) or being affected by gravity.
The collision object has different physical properties and its spatial extents are defined by one or more _shapes_.
You can either link a shape from a file in the _Collision Shape_-field or add different shapes from the context menu.

Types
-----

The three different _types_ defines how the position is controlled.

* *Static* - the collision object will never move, which is beneficial for performance
* *Dynamic* - the collision object is affected by gravity and other collision objects, also moves the game object
* *Kinematic* - the collision object is moved by the game object (e.g. a script component), but can still affects other collision objects
* *Trigger* - the collision object is moved by the game object (e.g. a script component), but does not affect other collision objects (gives collision response but no contact points)

Collision Filtering
-------------------

For two collision objects to collide, they must have matching _groups_ and _masks_.
A group is a name that groups all objects that share the same set of objects to collide with.
Examples could be "player", "enemy", "hazard", "ladder" or whatever fits your application.
You can have a maximum of 16 different groups in the application.

For a collision object to collide with another object, it must have the group of the other object in its mask.
Remember that the same holds for the other object you want to collide with.
That object must also have the group of the first object in its mask.
If you want an object to collide with many different groups, you should put a comma between each one in the mask.
A collision object with an empty mask won't collide with anything.

Here's an example of how to make a player object collide with an enemy object:

* *Player*
** _Group_: +player+
** _Mask_: +enemy+
* *Enemy*
** _Group_: +enemy+
** _Mask_: +player+
