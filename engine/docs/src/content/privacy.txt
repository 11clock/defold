=====================

This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information.
Users can access the Defold service (the "*Service*") through our website link:http://www.defold.com[www.defold.com] and applications on Devices.
A "*Device*" is any computer used to access the Defold Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.
This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Defold Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.
All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as "information".

1. The Information We Collect And Store
---------------------------------------

We may collect and store the following information when running the Defold Service:

Information You Provide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, email address and masked credit card details.
When you invite others to join Defold by using our invitation service, we send them a one-time email for that invitation.
We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to invite you to Defold.

Files
~~~~~

We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Defold Service ("*Files*").

Log Data
~~~~~~~~

When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services.
This may include the Device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, identification numbers associated with your Devices, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.

Cookies
~~~~~~~

We also use "cookies" to collect information and improve our Services.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device.
We may use "persistent cookies" to save your credentials for future logins to the Service.
We may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.

2. How We Use Personal Information
----------------------------------

Personal Information

If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any of those communications.

Geo-Location Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS).
Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services.

Analytics
~~~~~~~~~

We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information.
We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service's technical administration, to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests.
As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics.

No Personal Information will be publically visible.
This does not include some of the third parties services for which you register separately.
We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party service.
Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public.
Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.

Service Providers, Business Partners and Others
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service's features).
These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.
As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon’s AWS storage services to store some of your information (for example, your Files).

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Defold's Rights

We may disclose to parties outside Defold files stored in your Defold projects and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Defold or its users; or (d) to protect Defold’s property rights.

Business Transfers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy.
We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.

We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

6. Defold Community

Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account.
For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact info@defold.com.

Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Defold.
If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements.
We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.

7. Security
-----------

The security of your information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on the order forms of our third parties services, they encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at info@defold.com.

8. Our Policy Toward Children
-----------------------------

Our Services are not directed to persons under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@defold.com.
If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.
