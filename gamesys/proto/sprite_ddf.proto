/*# plays a sprite animation
 * <p>
 * Post this message to a sprite-component to make it play an animation of its tiles.
 * The tiles are enumerated starting with 1 at top left and then right along each row.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are several different playback modes to use for the animation:
 * <table>
 *   <th>Mode</th><th>Value</th><th>Description</th>
 *   <tr><td><code>PLAYBACK_NONE</code></td><td>0</td><td>Moves to the specified start frame, but stops there</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><code>PLAYBACK_ONCE_FORWARD</code></td><td>1</td><td>Plays from start to end and stops</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><code>PLAYBACK_ONCE_BACKWARD</code></td><td>2</td><td>Plays from end to start and stops</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><code>PLAYBACK_LOOP_FORWARD</code></td><td>3</td><td>Plays from start to end and restarts from the start frame</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><code>PLAYBACK_LOOP_BACKWARD</code></td><td>4</td><td>Plays from end to start and restarts from the end frame</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><code>PLAYBACK_LOOP_PINGPONG</code></td><td>5</td><td>Plays from start to end, from end to start, from start to end, etc</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is important to use the modes properly. Assume that a sprite has 9 tiles and
 * we want to play an animation backwards from frames 3 to 1. If we specify 3 as
 * <code>start_frame</code> and 1 as <code>end_frame</code> and mode
 * <code>PLAYBACK_ONCE_FORWARD</code>, the animation would play from frame 3,
 * continue to frame 9 and then wrap around to frame 1.
 * </p>

 * @message
 * @name play_animation
 * @param start_frame the start frame, or tile, of the animation (number)
 * @param end_frame the end frame, or tile, of the animation (number)
 * @param playback playback mode of the animation, see above for a description (number)
 * @param fps the playback speed measured as frames per second, 30 by default (number)

 * <p>
 * In the examples, it is assumed that the instance of the script has a sprite-component with id "sprite". The sprite itself is assumed to be a 3x3 tile map, targeted at 30 fps.
 * </p>
 * How to play a simple animation of a 3x3 tile sprite, from first to last frame:
 * <pre>
 * msg.post("#sprite", "play_animation", {start_frame = 1, end_frame = 9, playback = 1})
 * </pre>
 * How to sequence two animations together. The first animation plays forward along the first row and the second plays backwards along the last row.
 * <pre>
 * function init(self)
 *     -- play first animation at init
 *     msg.post("#sprite", "play_animation", {start_frame = 1, end_frame = 3, playback = 1})
 * end
 *
 * function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
 *     -- check for animation done response
 *     if message_id == hash("animation_done") then
 *         -- start the second backwards aniation
 *         msg.post("#sprite", "play_animation", {start_frame = 6, end_frame = 9, playback = 1})
 *     end
