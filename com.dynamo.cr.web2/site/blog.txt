Update - Sprite Design, Tile Fixes & Content Pipeline
-----------------------------------------------------
*_October 31, 2011_*

Sprites
~~~~~~~

We have completed the first iteration of how sprites should be integrated with the tile sets.
Here is a list of the features included in the first version:

* Predefined animations in the sprite component
* Play animations for previewing in the editor
* Play animations in-game from scripts
* "Animation done" notification message to scripts
* Animated collision geometry
* User-defined cues at specified frames (to trigger sounds etc)
* Color tinting from scripts

To achieve better efficiency and higher quality, we are also trying out a modified development process for new features.
It looks roughly like this:

. Initial design (Phase 1)
. Feedback
. Revise design
. _Pause_
. Design (Phase 2)
. Planning - Break down into use-cases/stories/cases
. Implement with TDD (Test Driven Development)
. Initial Deployment
. Testing
. Bug reports and feature requests
. Prioritize
. Fix bugs and implement feature requests
. Deployment of 1.0

Right now we have come to the _Pause_ stage.
The idea is to let the design settle and be able to come back to it later with a fresh mind.
In the mean-time, we will continue to work on the design for the new Game Object editor.

Tiles
~~~~~

We had some collision issues with the new tile system.
It turned out that when aligning blocks to form ground and other continuous shapes that span over several cells, objects could fall through between the cells.
This issue has been fixed.

Another related problem is that not all of such cells are properly stitched together.
This causes little "bumps" to remain in the collision geometry, sometimes causing objects that slide across the surface to get stuck.
(The images are by courtesy of Mikael SÃ¤ker.)

We are still working on a solution for this, but we did improve the in-game physics debugging.
It is much easier to see what's going on, physics-wise, in the games now.

To enable and control the debugging, the following options are now available in the game.project-files:

* physics.debug - 1 to enable, 0 to disable
* physics.debug_alpha - alpha value to use for all physics debug rendering, 0.0-1.0
* physics.debug_scale - how big things like normals should appear on screen

Here is a sample of a game.project-file:

[source,txt]
----
[physics]
debug = 1
debug_alpha = 0.8
debug_scale = 30

Content Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A long term goal we have is to enable users to build content locally on their own machines, in addition to the Defold-servers.
The biggest advantage of this is that build times would be lower, since we wouldn't have to send data back and forth over the internet.
Another advantage is that users can work and build content off-line.
It also means that we can integrate the pipeline into the editor, which in turn means better and more unified error handling.

The work has come a long way already and we are implementing a prototype at the moment to run tests on.

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

Currently, our roadmap looks like this:

. Tile Usability - Any known and new issues, workflow improvements, etc
. Game Object Editor Design - Better preview and editing support for components inside the game object editor
. Sprite Planning & Implementation
. Content Pipeline Prototype
. Documentation - User Manual, Tutorials, etc
. Website - Re-designed layout and structure

That's it at this time!
Hope you enjoyed reading and, as usual, let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Update - Tiles & Properties
--------------------------
*_October 23, 2011_*

Welcome to the first update-post from Defold!
This is a way for us to tell you a bit about what has happened lately and what lies ahead.

Tiles
~~~~~

We are very excited to have completed the first iteration of our tile-system.
Tiles are typically used whenever you want to place a lot of images in a grid based fashion,
for example in platformers, RTS- and TD-games.

To start putting tiles into your game, you first need to create a 'tile set' (.tileset).
In the tile set, you specify the image containing the tiles, as well as metrics on how you have ordered your tiles inside the image.
If you also specify an image for collision, collision hulls will be automatically generated for the tiles.

Please see the new menu *Tile Set* in the top menu bar for more of the features available when you are working with tile sets.
    
The next step is to create a 'tile grid'.
The tile grid is a new component that takes care of rendering and physics for the tiles in-game.
To be able to do this, the system needs to know which tile set you want to fetch the tiles from.
To start painting tiles into your grid, select a layer in the outline view.
If you look at the top menu bar, there is now a new menu called *Tile Grid* available.
Select *Tile Grid > Show Palette* to bring up the tile set you specified.

Click on a tile you want to use, which will turn the cursor into a brush with that tile selected.
Paint your tiles, rinse and repeat.
To erase painted tiles, open the palette again.
Click on the selected tile, which will turn the cursor into an eraser.

To finally bring your newly painted tiles into the game, add the tile grid as a component to a game object present in the game.
If you also want to have collision on the tiles, add a collision object component to the same game object and specify
the tile grid as its collision shape.

Another cool thing is that you can change the tiles in-game from your logic scripts.
Check out the new 'set_tile' message in the documentation ('GameSys').

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

We have also completely revamped the property system used by the editor.
The most noticable thing is that the layout has changed from grid-based to form-based.
We have also started to employ a new usage-philosophy, which is that all user input should be accepted.
The input is still validated, but any errors or other message is now displayed in a non-intrusive way next to the related input fields.
No more annoying popup dialogs! :-)

All of this new editor functionality is of course up to Defold-standards, which means complete support for:

* Undo/redo
* Reload
* Refactoring

What we haven't fixed yet however (among others) are:

* More convenient tools for painting/editing tiles (please contribute with your own suggestions!)
* Reload of tile grids in-game
* Sprites are still created/animated as usual

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

This is our roadmap, as it looks at this very moment, ordered from sooner to later.

. Sprite re-design - How to incorporate sprites better with the new tile system
. Tile Usability - Any known and new issues, workflow improvements, etc
. Game Object editor - Better preview and editing support for components inside the game object editor
. Documentation - User Manual, Tutorials, etc
. Website - Re-designed layout and structure

We really hope you enjoyed reading this.
As always, we would love to hear any feedback, change requests, complaints or other issues you experience while using Defold.
Direct them to the usual cases-mail.
Now go ahead and make a more original game than we did! ;-)
