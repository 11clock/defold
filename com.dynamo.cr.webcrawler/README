How to update the crawler:

* Go to http://defoldcrawler.appspot.com/
* Set Domain to www.defold.se
* Set Index to http://www.defold.se
* It's seems to be important that Domain and Index match as in the example above
* Repeat for .com

* The default fetchRatio is 7 days. Go to Datastore Viewer in the admin page and change to 1
