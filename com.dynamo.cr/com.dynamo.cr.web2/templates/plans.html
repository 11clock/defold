    <p>
        We charge for Defold by the size of your teams.
        By team size, we mean the total number of people working on a project.
        For example, if you get the <b>Small</b> plan you can join projects with one member, or invite one person to your own projects.
        The fees below are per person and month.
        You can currently only create a limited amount of projects, but join as many as you like.
    </p>
    <h2>Important</h2>
    <p>
        During the Beta phase, we have removed the upper limit on the team size for the <b>Small</b> plan.
        When the Beta phase ends, that plan will be limited to a team size of two people.

                <p>"The Defold engine and tools are built on powerful and simple concepts that are fun to use
                    because they work with me and allows me to focus on my game's specific design problems. It clearly
                    shows that the Defold developers have put their long industry experience and massive design and
                    implementation effort into creating a great, unique platform."</p>

                    came highly recommended. With its powerful and simple platform, i was
                    able to work on my game app development faster, easier, and cost less than
