            <h2>No Setup</h2>
            <p>The Defold Editor is the only software you need to install to create your games. It runs on Windows, OS X and Linux.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span3">
            <h2>Flexible</h2>
            <p>The engine builds on simple concepts used to create complex things. It is extremely data-driven and flexible. The game logic and rendering pipeline are scripted in Lua.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span3">
            <h2>Fast Iterations</h2>
            <p>The time for a change to appear in the running game is less than a second, even on your iOS device. Prototype, build, polish and iterate.</p>

                <p>"The Defold engine and tools are built on powerful and simple concepts that are fun to use
                    because they work with me and allows me to focus on my game's specific design problems. It clearly
                    shows that the Defold developers have put their long industry experience and massive design and
                    implementation effort into creating a great, unique platform."</p>
