Welcome to Defold!
==================

This introduction describes some basic concepts of the platform, which features are available and how the editor works.

Concepts
--------

There are a few different concepts in the Defold platform that could use some explanation.
We recommend that you give it a glance even if you are an experienced game developer, since things might work a bit different around here.

Game Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The different objects that make up your game world are called game objects.
A player avatar, a fired projectile, enemies and decorations are different examples.
A game object works like a blueprint and can be cloned into multiple copies.
When you modify a game object all copies are updated automatically.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

Components are used to extend game objects with functionality, e.g. graphics, sounds, collisions or behaviour.
They usually reside inside the game objects, meaning they are defined in the same files.
If you want to reuse a component among several game objects, you can put it into a separate file.
This file can then be referenced by the different game objects.

((((
image::images/engine/components_2.png["Components", align="center"]
((((

Messages
~~~~~~~~

Components communicate via messages.
They can be sent between any two components, whether or not they belong to the same game object.
Messages are used to notify components that something should happen, e.g. hide the graphics, turn off collisions or play a sound.

Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection contains positioned game objects.
They are most commonly used to build levels.
Collections can contain other collections, which are then called sub-collections.
This allows you to reuse recurring game object setups at different locations in your level, like an enemy carrying a power-up item.

This is an example of how a common game scenario is expressed in the Defold platform.
We have two players, each controlling a flying saucer.
At the top of the screen, their different scores are displayed.

((((
image::images/engine/collection.png["Collection", align="center"]
((((

The scores at the top of the screen are built as a separate game object with an attached Gui-component (graphical user interface, more below).
The two player avatars, the space ships, are two different game objects with a few components attached; graphics, sounds and scripts to control input-based movement.

Factories
~~~~~~~~~

When a collection is loaded in the game, all the game objects will be created and end up at their specified positions.
If you want to add game objects on the fly during the game, you can use a factory component.

((((
image::images/engine/factory.png["Factory", align="center"]
((((

Each factory has a reference to the game objects it can create.
To make it create more game objects, send it a message:

[source,lua]
----
msg.post("#factory", "create")
----

where +factory+ is the identifier of the factory component attached to the game object and +create+ is the message the factory component responds to.

Scripting
~~~~~~~~~

All scripts in Defold are written in the Lua programming language.
They let you specify the rules of your game, how game objects should interact and respond to player input.
The link:#reference:engine[reference manual] contains descriptions and examples of all the available functions and messages.
Lua in itself can be used for many different things.
Please see the documentation on the link:http://www.lua.org[Lua site] and on the link:http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaDirectory[Lua wiki].
The actual Lua-code to play an explosion sound of a game object can look like this:

[source,lua]
----
msg.post("#explosion", "play_sound")
----

where +explosion+ is the identifier of the sound component attached to the game object and +play_sound+ the message the sound component responds to.
When scripting, remember that no data is shared among the scripts.
Components (including scripts) only exchange information through message passing, specifically using the function link:#reference:script/msg.post[+msg.post+].

Collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Very few people can make games by themselves.
We think the ability to work together is key for efficient development.
This is why we have tried to make collaboration a corner stone of the Defold platform.

((((
image::images/engine/collaboration.png["Collaboration", align="center"]
((((

When you create a new project, a central repository is automatically created on our servers.
During development, the files you create and modify are actually a personal view of this repository.
When you are ready to share your changes, you can synchronize your personal view with the central repository from inside the editor.
This allows other members to receive your changes and you to receive any changes from them.
The changes are recorded and available as a history of what's happened in your project.
Backup and emailing files back and forth won't be necessary.

Common Building Blocks
----------------------

These are the most common building blocks used when creating a game.

Game Object
~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/brick.png["Game Object"]

Game objects are blueprints which describe the types of elements that make up your game, e.g. player avatars, enemies, weapons and power-ups.

Collection
~~~~~~~~~~

((((
image::images/icons/bricks.png["Collection"]
((((

A collection defines which game objects should appear where.
They can be used for many things, from large levels to small recurring sets of game objects.

Script
~~~~~~

image:images/icons/cog.png["Script"]

A script component defines the behaviour of a game object, like how it should move around in the game world.
They can also define how the user can control it through input and how the other components in the game object should be behave.
An example of this can be to turn on some special effect whenever the player is invulnerable.

Sound
~~~~~

image:images/icons/sound.png["Sound"]

The sound component can play a specific sound.
Currently only wav-files are supported.

Collision Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/weight.png["Collision Object"]

Collision objects define the physical properties of game objects and how they should collide with other game objects. See "Physics" below for more information.

Factory
~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/factory.png["Factory"]

A factory is used to create other game objects in the game world on the fly.
They can be used to make enemies appear from some source or make power-ups appear.

Tile Set
~~~~~~~~
image:images/icons/small_tiles.png["Tile Set"]

A tile set describes a texture that is composed of multiple smaller images.
You can define animations of the smaller images in the tile set.
It can also calculate collision shapes automatically from image data.
They are used by the sprite and tile grid components to share graphics resources.

Sprite2
~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/pictures.png["Sprite 2"]

A sprite is an image that can be flip-book animated by using tile sets.

Tile Grid
~~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/layer_grid.png["Tile Grid"]

Tile grid components display images from a tile set in a grid based fashion.
It is most commonly used to build the environment of the game world, e.g. ledges in a platform-game or obstacles in an RTS-game.
It also supports automatic generation of collision shapes based on the images.

((((

Gui
~~~

image:images/icons/text_allcaps.png["Gui"]

A gui component contains different elements used for user interfaces, like texts and textured blocks.
The elements can be animated and are typically used for Heads-Up Displays, menu systems and notifications for the users.
It uses a gui script, which defines the behaviour of the Gui and how the user can interact with it.

((((
image::images/editor/gui.png["Gui", align="center"]
((((

Gui Script
~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/cog.png["Script"]

Gui scripts are used to define the behaviour of gui components.
This include how the user can interact with them, how information such as score and lives are presented and animations when specific events occur.

Font
~~~~

image:images/icons/font.png["Font"]

Fonts are based on a TrueType Font-file.
They specify which font size to use and what type of decoration (outline and shadow) it should have.

((((
image::images/editor/font.png["Font", align="center"]
((((

Input Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/keyboard.png["Input Binding"]

Input binding files define how the game should interpret hardware input (e.g. keyboard/mouse, touch pads and game pads).
In short, you define high-level input actions, like "jump", "move_forward", etc, which are then mapped to hardware input.
You can then take action on the high-level input in the Lua-scripts, without having to consider which hardware was actually used.

((((

Other Building Blocks
---------------------

Camera
~~~~~~

image:images/icons/camera.png["Camera"]

Camera components helps to decide what part of the game world should be visible and how it should be projected.
A common example is to attach a camera to the player game object, or having a separate camera that follows the player around.

Material
~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/large_tiles.png["Material"]

Materials define how different objects should be rendered by specifying shaders and their properties.

Render
~~~~~~

image:images/icons/paintcan.png["Render"]

Render files represents the rendering pipeline which makes your game appear on the screen.
They define which Render Script to use for rendering and the different materials to use for things such as post effects.

Render Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/cog.png["Render Script"]

A render script controls how the game should be rendered to the screen.
It is mostly used for advanced rendering like custom lighting models or other effects.
The default render script should cover the most common cases in your projects.

Collection Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/icons/bricks_proxy.png["Collection Proxy"]

A collection proxy can be used to load and present collections on the fly during a game.
The most common example would be that you want to start your game as fast as possible without loading any level-data.
You can then use collection proxies to load and start your levels at a later time.

Editor Overview
---------------

The editor contains almost all the tools necessary to make your games, except graphics and sound editing.

*IMAGE PLACEHOLDER* editor overview

*NOTE* Det relevanta ur den här texten borde ingå i bilden och det här stycket tas bort

To the upper left is the Project Explorer.
Once you open a project, it is filled with the files from that project.
Below it is the Changed Files view.
It lists all the files you have modified and is cleared when you synchronize or revert the changes.
In the middle is the Content view.
It contains a tab for each file you have opened.
The Outline view is to the upper right and displays the structure of the currently selected file.
Below it is the Properties view.
It displays the properties of the currently selected object.

Updating the editor is very easy.
We always let you know when there is a new version to fetch and what it contains.
