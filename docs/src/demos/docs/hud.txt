Hud
===

In this sample, we demonstrate effects for score counting.
The scores appear randomly over the screen, simulating a game where the player obtains scores at different positions.

The scores float for a while after they appear.
To achieve this, we set the scores to transparent and then fade in their color.
We also animate them upwards. This is done in +on_message+ below.

Then they move up to the total score in the top of the screen where they are summed up.
They are also slightly fading out while moving up.
This is done in +float_done+.

When they have reached the top score, their amounts are added to a target score that the total score counts up towards.
This is done in +swoosh_done+.

When the script is updated, it checks if the target score has been increased and the total score needs to be counted up.
When this is true, the total score is incremented by a smaller step.
The scale of the total score is then animated to give a bouncing effect.
This is done in +update+.

Each time the total is incremented, we spawn an amount of smaller stars and animate them out from the total score.
The stars are spawned, animated and deleted in +spawn_stars+, +fade_out_star+ and +delete_star+.
