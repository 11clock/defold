Main Manu
=========

In this sample, we demonstrate effects to present a main menu.
The menu contains a background and two menu items.

link:#new_project:[Create a project] and select +Sample: Main Menu+ as 'Project Template' to try it out for yourself.

link:/youtube_embed/main_menu.ivf[Main Menu]

Each of the background and the two menu items, have the same animations applied to them, but with different delays.
This is set up in +init+ below.

The first animations is to have each node fade in while being scaled from 70% to 110%.
This is done in +anim1+.

During the following animations, the scale is animated back and forth from 110% to 98%, to 106% and then to 100%.
This gives the bouncing effect and is done in +anim2+, +anim3+ and +anim4+.

The background has a special slight fade out at the end, which is applied in +anim5+.
