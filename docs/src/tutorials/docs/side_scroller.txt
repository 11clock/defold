Tutorial: Side-Scroller
=======================

Follow this tutorial to get a taste of what making games in Defold is about.
It will help you create a new project, based on a simple side-scroller.
Then you will learn how to tweak the game to make it more fun and finally add another game object.
It shouldn't take more than *FIX ME* x minutes.

The game is extremely simple.
The player controls a space ship and is supposed to collect stars that flies across the screen by moving up and down.

Setup
-----

. Start by link:/#new_project:[creating a new project].
  The tutorial is already pre-selected as the template project.
. Start the editor and open the project you just created with *File > Open Project*.
. Select your project and click *Next*.
. Create a new branch. A branch is like a personal view of the project.
  Other members of your project won't see your changes until you synchronize your branch (which can be done with *File > Synchronize*).
. Try the game with *Project > Build And Launch*.

Tweaking
--------

We will now tweak the game in order to make it more fun.
You can exit the game with the *ESC*-key, but let's keep the game running and update it live.
Switch back to the editor.

The speed of the space ship could be faster.

. Open the file +spaceship.script+ with *Edit > Open Resource...*.
. In the beginning of the file, change:
+
[source,lua]
---------------
local player_speed = 60
---------------
+
to:
+
[source,lua]
---------------
local player_speed = 150
---------------
+
This will increase the movement speed of the space ship.

. Reload the file while the game is running with *Edit > Reload Resource*.
. Try moving the space ship with the arrow-keys on your keyboard.
  Notice how the it moves faster now.

Currently, the player only gets 1 point for each star collected.
We need to raise the score!

. Open the file +star.script+.
. In the beginning of the file, change:
+
[source,lua]
---------------
local score = 1
---------------
+
to:
+
[source,lua]
------------------
local score = 1000
------------------

. Reload the file again with *Edit > Reload Resource*.
. Collect some stars and notice how the score has dramatically increased.

Add a Bonus Star
----------------

The game would be a bit more interesting if bonus stars would appear now and then.

Create the Game Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Add a new game object called +bonus_star.go+ in the +stars+-directory with *File New > Sprite2*.
  This is the blueprint for the new bonus stars.
. Add a _Sprite2_ component to the game object with *Game Object > Add Component*.
  The sprite is the visual representation of the star.
. Set _Tile Set_ to +stars.tileset+, which contains the image for the bonus star.
. Set _Default Animation_ to bonus_star, which is a 1-frame animation of the bonus star.
. Add a _Collision Object_ component to the game object with *Game Object > Add Component*.
. Set its _Type_ to +Kinematic+, which means that the collision object will follow the game object.
. Set its _Mask_ to +default+, which means it will collide with the space ship.
. Add a sphere shape to the collision object (*I*), which defines its boundary as far as collisions are concerned.
. Scale it in the scene view until it covers the image of the star (*R*).
  You can also move the sphere by pressing *W*.
. Add the script +bonus_star.script+ to the game object with *Game Object > Add Component From File*.
  The script moves the bonus stars and make sure the player gets the right amount of points for catching them.

Create a Factory Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Open the file +star_factory.go+ with *Edit > Open Resource...*.
. Add another Factory component to it with *Game Object > Add Component*.
  This factory will create the new bonus star.
. Set its _Id_ to +bonus_factory+.
. Set its _Prototype_ to +bonus_star.go+.

Modify the Factory Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Open +factory.script+ with *Edit > Open Resource...*.
. Near the bottom of the file, change:
+
[source,lua]
-------------------------------
-- component = "#bonus_factory"
-------------------------------
+
to:
+
[source,lua]
----------------------------
component = "#bonus_factory"
----------------------------
+
This makes the bonus stars appear roughly 20% of the time.

. Restart the game by closing the window (or *ESC*) to exit, then *Project > Build and Launch* in the editor.
  The new bonus stars will start to appear!

You Win!
