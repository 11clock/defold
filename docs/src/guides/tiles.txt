Tile Grids
==========

A tile grid is a component which is used for placing tiles over an area in a grid-based fashion, typically a level.
The tiles are fetched from a tile set and can also have physics attached for collision detection.

Painting Tiles
--------------

. Open the tile grid you want to paint in.
. Make sure there are no flagged issues in the Property or Outline views.
. Select a layer to paint into in the Outline.
. Select a tile to use (*Space* to show the palette).

Attaching Physics
-----------------

. Open the tile set you connected to the tile grid.
.. Make sure the tile set you connected to the tile grid has an image set for collisions.
   They should be rendered as lines on top of the texture in the Editor view.
.. Make sure you have painted collision groups in the tile set for the tiles to support collision.
. Open the game object to which you have added the tile grid.
.. Add a collision object component.
... Set its type to static.
... Add the collision group of the game objects you want it to collide with in its mask.
... Add the tile grid as its shape.
. Open the other game objects you want to collide with the tile grid.
.. Make sure they have collision objects. Check that the collision groups of the tiles are added to their masks.
