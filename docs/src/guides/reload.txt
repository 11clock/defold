Hot Reloading
=============

NOTE: This is not yet implemented for collections, game objects and tile maps.

While the game is running, you can edit a file and reload it inside the running game with *Edit > Reload* Resource.
This is a simple way to test your changes without having to restart the game.

For scripts, there is a special callback function called link:#reference:go/on_reload[+on_reload+], which is called each time that script is reloaded.
It's perfect to use to reset some part of the game for testing purposes.
